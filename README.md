# overlookHotel

Copycat webpage based on the webpage here: http://www.opendesigns.org/design/mooddy-hotel/

I used an absolutely positioned background layer underneath the flexbox navbar to have it stretch the way I wanted. I also used the default Bootstrap carousel. There is an odd triangle cut-out at the bottom of the carousel. I did this to mirror the example from above.
